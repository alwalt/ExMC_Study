## Prompt for LLM
### Question:
How should the crew assess the vital signs of an unconscious astronaut after a micrometeoroid has impacted the space vehicle, causing a breach in the hull and a drop in internal pressure?
 
### Answer:
The patient should be placed in a pressure suit after the other crewmembers finish donning their suits. It will be difficult to accurately assess the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation); however, the crew assessing the patient should:
Look for water vapor condensation on the inside of the visor.
Look and feel for chest rise and fall.
If the patient is wearing a remote vital signs and cardiac monitor, check the data feed from the monitor.
